# Current Risk

**Current Risk for model to work off, may or may not be feasible**

**Similarity Score**: How similar claims are to each other

**Complextity Score**: How complex are the claims

**Length**: Length of claims

**Reviewer Risk**: What potential risk could an individual person bring
Current potential Risk: Inexperience, poor reflection(Bad tone and arguments), Rejection made unfairly, 
timeliness rather than quality, Would not help move patents along(ex, office action ignores new claims and copy
paste the same previous office action), lack of clarity, limited prior art search, potential hindsight bias,
overboard application of broadest reasonable construction rule, broadest combination reference based on word search,
Lack of ability to remove examiner from cases who lack technical expertise or have bias, consistency. 

**Appeal Rates** 

**Average Events in History**: How many events between getting application to granting patents, more events could tie
to higher complextity score as well as "potential" issues with the patent application itself. 

**Time to First Office Action**: How long does it take to send an office action
Total Pendancy/Disposal: Total time

**High RCE**: Application thought closed that is reopened. Can be used to increase score for quality section in PAP
Appeal Rates

**Outlier in similar Art/Technology Center**: More so seeing if there is an outlier for a single person 
or art unit compared to the average

**USC 103 Rejections**: Based on external survey done, there seems to be an issue about 103 rejections specifically,
whether it be the inability to remove, or lack of evidence when proposing this rejection

**Rejection type**: Specifically, rejection types, there is some drops from last survey, as well as just in general, there are instances where rejection is not adminstrated(Forgot the word here) correctly?
